# MORE DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON

This project gives an introduction into sets, dictionaries as well as function like filter map lamba and reduce in python.

## 0-square_matrix_simple.py

This file contains a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

- Prototype: ``` def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]): ```
	* ``` matrix ``` is a 2D  array.
- Return:
	* a new matrix the same size as *matrix*
	* each value should be the square if the value of the input.
